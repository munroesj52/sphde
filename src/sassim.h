/**! \file sassim.h
*  \brief Shared Address Space, base runtime
*	for shared and persistent memory for multi-thread/multi-core applications.
*
*   Provides APIs to manage (setup and take-down) the SAS Region and
*   backing store for cooperating processes. The region is a contiguous
*   subrange of the process address space. The exact range varies based
*   on the platform on the platform (as defined in sasconf.h).
*
*   Associated with an active SAS region is SAS Store which is a
*   directory contain backing files which are memory mapped for the
*   active portions of the region.
*   A region is fully qualified by its SAS Store (directory)
*   path. Processes joined to the same SAS story are accessing the
*   same data at the same virtual address.
*
*   \note: For Linux this means memory mapping the pages from the
*   kernel's file cache, and so we are sharing the same real pages
*   across all partipating processes.
*   This enables zero copy sharing and persistence.
*
*   Processes using different SAS Store paths are accessing
*   logically different and disjoint regions. A process can only access
*   one SAS region but there is no limit (other than files system
*   capacity) to the number different SAS regions accessed by
*   different groups of cooperating processes.
*
*   The SAS region address range and backing file store are managed
*   via a power of 2 buddy system. Logically the region is divided into
*   segments and blocks. Segment are a fixed power of 2 size (defined
*   for the platform by sasconf.h) and alignment within the region.
*   Blocks are a variable power of 2 size and have an alignment
*   matching their size or better. Logically blocks are sub-allocated
*   from allocated segments (have a backing file and can be mmaped)
*   which are sub-allocated from the region.
*
*   \todo The current runtime restricts blocks to segment size or
*   smaller. Creating larger blocks would require creating (power of 2) multiple
*   segments (and backing files which have to memory mapped) while
*   holding the global anchor block lock. Future releases may remove
*   this restriction.
*
*   \note Segments and blocks inherit their virtual address (within the
*   process) from the region. The region has a fixed starting address
*   and segments always have a unique offset (and file index) within the
*   region. The segment's file index is used to generate the unique file
*   name within the SAS store directory. Obviously blocks inherit their
*   virtual address from the containing segment which inherits from the
*   region.
*
*   The segment is the granule of backing file allocation and memory
*   mapping. Segment backing files are always extended to the full
*   segment size at creation.  This minimizes OS overhead by minimizing
*   file system and memory mapping operations at runtime. Segments are
*   not allocated (and backing files created) until additional block
*   space is needed (when free block space, of the required size and
*   alignment, in currently allocated segments, is depleted).
*   This is done implicitly under the block allocate call.
*
*   \note SASJoinRegion and related functions (SASTHreadSetUp)
*   establish a sigaction handler for signal SIGSEGV.
*   This handles the case when one process,
*   sharing a named Region allocates a new segment and backing.  Other
*   processes (sharing the same Region) are not immediately aware of
*   this and need not perform any specific actions until or unless that
*   process references data in that segment.  This will generate a
*   SIGSEGV and the SAS sigaction handler will attach this segment by
*   mmapping the associated backing file into the faulting process at
*   the assigned address.
*
*   \note Applications that set their own signal to sigaction handlers
*   for SIGSEGV should be aware of this and plan for proper nesting.
*   Applications should establish their SIGSEGV handlers before
*   joining.  The SASJoinRegion will preserve the the "old action" as
*   part of setting it own SIGSEGV handler.
*
*   \note When the SPHDE runtime handler gets control it will verify
*   that the faulting address is within the SAS Region. If it is not,
*   it is likely a error or something that the application should
*   handle itself. The SPHDE runtime handler  will check if the
*   "old action" was SIG_DFL or has it own signal or sigaction handler.
*   If the application defined it own handler SPHDE will attempt to
*   call that handler.  Otherwise SPHDE runtime handler will print a
*   back trace and exit the effected process (or thread).
*
*   The runtime also sets up shared memory segments (shmat) for SAS locks.
*   SAS locks need to be shared but should not persist across reboot
*   (like memory mapped files do). Different SAS stores must have
*   independent locks (different lock segments).
*   So lock segments are allocated/attached via shmget/shmat using a
*   key generated (ftok) from the SAS Store path.
